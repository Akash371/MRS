This project is focussed on building a custom chatbot that will be your crucial stage of the expectation to absorb information of building your own proficient chatbots.

We would be building an extensive chatbot service, to which you can talk to, and talking to a chatbot would not business-driven. It would just be the casual conservations. Further, on top of it, the chatbot would also be recommending songs to the user based on the tone of the user. This recommendation feature employs the use of last.fm API, very much similar to the popular Spotify API. Also, for tone/emotion analysis of the conservation we will be using the text2emotion library of python.

text2emotion is the python package which will help you to extract the emotions from the content. Processes any textual message and recognize the emotions embedded in it. Compatible with 5 different emotion categories as Happy, Angry, Sad, Surprise and Fear.
